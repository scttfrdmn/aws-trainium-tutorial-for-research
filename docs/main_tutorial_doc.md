### Why AWS ML Chips for Academic Research?

**The Cost Reality Check:**
- NVIDIA A100 (p4d.24xlarge): $32.77/hour
- NVIDIA H100 (p5.48xlarge): $98.32/hour  
- AWS Trainium2 (trn2.48xlarge): ~$40/hour (est.)
- AWS Inferentia2 (inf2.48xlarge): $12.98/hour

**For a typical 2-week experiment:**
- H100: $98.32 × 24 × 14 = **$33,035**
- Trainium2: $40 × 24 × 14 = **$13,440** (59% savings)
- With spot instances: ~$4,032 (88% savings)

### What You'll Learn
1. How to never accidentally leave instances running
2. Setting up automatic cost controls and alerts
3. Using containers for reproducible, ephemeral experiments
4. Migrating CUDA code to AWS Neuron
5. Real research examples in your domain
6. Advanced patterns including NKI development and modern RAG

## 2. FinOps First: Cost Control from Day One {#finops-first}

### The #1 Rule: Nothing Runs Permanently

Before we write any ML code, let's set up safeguards to prevent runaway costs.

#### Step 1: Set Up Budget Alerts (5 minutes)

```bash
# First, install AWS CLI if you haven't
pip install awscli

# Configure with your academic credentials
aws configure
# Enter your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Region (us-east-1), and output format (json)
```

#### Step 2: Auto-Termination Scripts

**Never manually manage instances.** Always use scripts that auto-terminate. See `scripts/ephemeral_instance.py` for the complete implementation.

#### Step 3: Cost Dashboard

Create a simple cost tracking dashboard - see `monitoring/` directory for the complete S3-hosted dashboard.

## 3. AWS Fundamentals for ML Researchers {#aws-fundamentals}

### Essential AWS Concepts (15-minute crash course)

| AWS Concept | What It Means for ML Research | Academic Analogy |
|-------------|------------------------------|------------------|
| **EC2 Instance** | Virtual computer for training/inference | Like reserving a GPU node on HPC cluster |
| **S3 Bucket** | Cloud storage for datasets/models | Shared network drive, but accessible anywhere |
| **IAM Role** | Permissions for resources | Like your university login credentials |
| **VPC** | Private network for your resources | Your lab's private network |
| **AMI** | Pre-configured OS image | Like a Docker image for entire OS |
| **Spot Instance** | Discounted compute (can be interrupted) | Like standby queue on HPC |

## 5. Migrating from CUDA to Neuron {#cuda-migration}

### Understanding the Differences

| CUDA Concept | Neuron Equivalent | Key Differences |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `torch.cuda.is_available()` | `torch_xla.core.xla_model.xla_device()` | XLA device abstraction |
| `.cuda()` | `.to(xla_device)` | Explicit device placement |
| CUDA kernels | Neuron Kernel Interface (NKI) | Different syntax |
| cuDNN | Neuron optimized ops | Automatic in most cases |
| Mixed precision (AMP) | Native BF16 support | Built into hardware |
| NCCL | Neuron Collective Comm | Different but similar API |

See `scripts/neuron_migration.py` for the complete migration helper.

## 8. Complete Trainium → Inferentia Workflow {#complete-workflow}

### End-to-End Example: Climate Model Training and Deployment

This example shows the complete workflow of training a model on Trainium and deploying it on Inferentia for cost-effective inference.

**Key Features:**
- Training on Trainium2 with automatic cost tracking
- Model compilation for both training and inference
- Deployment on Inferentia2 with Flask API
- Real-time cost monitoring throughout
- 60-70% cost savings vs traditional GPU approaches

See `examples/complete_workflow/` for the full implementation.

**Cost Breakdown:**
- Training Phase: $144 for Llama 2 7B (vs $295 on H100)
- Inference Phase: $0.227/hour (vs $3.06/hour on GPU)
- Total Monthly Savings: $2,000+ for typical research workload

## 13. Advanced Patterns: NKI & Modern Architectures {#advanced-patterns}

### Neuron Kernel Interface (NKI) Development

For advanced users who want hardware-level optimization:

```python
import neuronxcc.nki as nki
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

@nki.jit
def flash_attention_kernel(q_tensor, k_tensor, v_tensor, scale):
    """Custom Flash Attention implementation for Trainium"""
    # NeuronCore has 24MB SBUF and 2MB PSUM
    # Tile computations to fit in on-chip memory
    
    batch, seq_len, d_head = q_tensor.shape
    assert seq_len <= nl.tile_size.pmax  # 128 max
    
    # Load Q, K, V tiles to SBUF (on-chip memory)
    q_tile = nl.load(q_tensor)
    k_tile = nl.load(k_tensor)
    v_tile = nl.load(v_tensor)
    
    # Compute attention scores in PSUM buffer
    scores = nl.matmul(q_tile, k_tile.transpose(), dtype=nl.float32)
    scores = nl.multiply(scores, scale)
    
    # Softmax (custom implementation for NeuronCore)
    scores_max = nl.max(scores, axis=-1, keepdim=True)
    scores_exp = nl.exp(nl.subtract(scores, scores_max))
    scores_sum = nl.sum(scores_exp, axis=-1, keepdim=True)
    attn_weights = nl.divide(scores_exp, scores_sum)
    
    # Apply attention to values
    output = nl.matmul(attn_weights, v_tile)
    
    # Store result back to HBM
    output_tensor = nl.ndarray(output.shape, dtype=q_tensor.dtype)
    nl.store(output_tensor, output)
    
    return output_tensor
```

        # Retrieve relevant documents
        docs, scores = self.retrieve(query, k=3)
        
        # Build context
        context = "\n\n".join([f"Document {i+1}: {doc}" for i, doc in enumerate(docs)])
        
        # Create prompt
        prompt = f"""Based on the following context, answer the question.

Context:
{context}

Question: {query}

Answer:"""
        
        # Generate response on Trainium/Inferentia
        response = self.llm.sample(
            prompt,
            max_length=max_length,
            top_k=50,
            top_p=0.95,
            temperature=0.7
        )
        
        return {
            'answer': response,
            'sources': docs,
            'scores': scores.tolist(),
            'inference_cost': self._calculate_inference_cost()
        }
```
